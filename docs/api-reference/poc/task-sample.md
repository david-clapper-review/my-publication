Here’s the **badly written procedural content** formatted in Markdown:

# How to do the thing

So, like, the first thing you’ll probably wanna do is make sure that you’ve downloaded the thing from the repo. The link is somewhere in the documentation, but you can probably find it if you search for “download.” Once you’ve got it, open up a terminal (I assume you’re on Linux or Mac—if not, no clue, good luck).

Then type something like:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

and run it, which will make it executable and stuff. This step is kind of important, but, like, it’s really obvious if you skip it because it won’t work. After that, go to the config file, which should be in the root directory, I think? Open it in a text editor and tweak the settings so they make sense for your environment. There’s some stuff in there about ports and database connections—just follow your instincts or ask your ops guy if you’re not sure.

Once you’ve got that all set up, start the app by running:

```bash
./start.sh
```

If you did everything right, you should see some logs, and if it doesn’t work, the logs might help. Or not. Anyway, let me know if you run into issues.
