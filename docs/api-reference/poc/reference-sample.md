# API Endpoints for the Thing

Here are the API endpoints that you can use to, like, do stuff with the thing. Some of these work, but some might be outdated—I’m not sure which ones though, lol.

## **1. GET /api/v1/thing**
- **Description**: Gets the thing.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id` (string): The ID of the thing you want. I think it’s required?
- **Response**:
  - Returns some JSON, probably. Something like this:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Example Thing",
      "status": "active"
    }
    ```
- **Notes**: This one is super useful for, like, checking if the thing exists.

## **2. POST /api/v1/thing**
- **Description**: Creates a new thing.
- **Parameters**:
  - `name` (string): Name of the thing. Make it something cool.
  - `description` (string): Optional, I guess? Not sure if it’s required.
- **Response**:
  - Returns a JSON object with the ID of the created thing. Or maybe it doesn’t if something breaks?
- **Notes**: Use this if you wanna make a thing, but don’t forget to, like, check the logs if it doesn’t work.

## **3. DELETE /api/v1/thing**
- **Description**: Deletes a thing.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id` (string): The ID of the thing to delete.
- **Response**:
  - Returns, like, nothing or maybe an error if the thing wasn’t found.
- **Notes**: Don’t delete things unless you really mean it, because there’s no undo (I think?).
