Improvement: Adopt a more formal and informative tone throughout the document. For example, replace \"you should totally use it\" with \"we recommend utilizing this tool for enhancing productivity in your projects.\"</p> <p>Completeness Insufficient Detail on Functionality: The explanation of how the tool works and what operations it performs is vague and lacks depth.</p> <p>Improvement: Provide specific examples of the operations the tool can perform, such as \"data transformation,\" \"file synchronization,\" or \"task scheduling.\"</p> <p>Reference to Documentation: The mention of other documentation without providing specific references or links is unhelpful.</p> <p>Improvement: Include direct links or references to relevant sections of the documentation for users who want to explore further.</p>"},{"location":"api-reference/poc/conceptual-sample/","title":"What is the thing?","text":"<p>The thing is like a super cool tool that you can use for doing stuff.
